## Project Overview

### Purpose
SpendWise is a personal expense tracking application built with Angular 20 that allows users to:
- Track personal expenses across multiple categories
- Visualize spending patterns through interactive charts
- Manage expense data with full CRUD operations
- Filter and search through expense history

### Key Technical Goals
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supporting future feature expansion
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimized change detection
- **Maintainability**: Clean code practices with comprehensive testing
- **User Experience**: Responsive design with real-time data updates

---

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture Choice

**Implementation**: The project uses Angular's NgModule system with feature-based organization:
```
src/app/
├── core/           # Singleton services, models, layout
├── features/       # Feature modules (expenses)
├── shared/         # Reusable components and services
└── app-routing-module.ts
```

**Reasoning**: 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
- **Lazy Loading**: Features can be loaded on-demand for better performance
- **Scalability**: New features can be added as separate modules
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the application

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Standalone Components (Angular 14+)**: Rejected because the project structure benefits from the explicit module boundaries for this size of application
- **Single Module**: Rejected due to lack of organization and no lazy loading benefits

### 2. State Management Approach

**Implementation**: Custom reactive state management using RxJS BehaviorSubject

**Reasoning**:
- **Simplicity**: No external state management library needed for this application size
- **Real-time Updates**: BehaviorSubject ensures all components receive immediate updates
- **Angular Integration**: Native RxJS integration with Angular's async pipe and reactive forms
- **Memory Efficiency**: Built-in subscription management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **NgRx**: Overkill for a single-entity (expenses) application
- **Akita**: Additional dependency not justified for project scope
- **Services with Subjects**: Chosen approach but with BehaviorSubject for state persistence

### 3. Routing Strategy

**Implementation**: Lazy loading with feature routing modules

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'expenses', pathMatch: 'full' },
  {
    path: 'expenses',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/expenses/expenses-module')
      .then(m => m.ExpensesModule)
  }
];
```

**Reasoning**:
- **Performance**: Code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new feature modules
- **User Experience**: Faster initial load time

## Core Module Analysis

### 1. Expense Interface & Enums (`core/models/expense.interface.ts`)

**Purpose**: Define the data structure and categories for expense entities

```typescript
export enum ExpenseCategory {
    FOOD = 'Food',
    TRANSPORTATION = 'Transportation',
    HOUSING = 'Housing',
    UTILITIES = 'Utilities',
    ENTERTAINMENT = 'Entertainment',
    SHOPPING = 'Shopping',
    HEALTHCARE = 'Healthcare',
    OTHER = 'Other'
}

export interface Expense {
    id: string;
    amount: number;
    category: ExpenseCategory;
    date: Date;
    note?: string;
    createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Implementation Reasoning**:
- **Enum for Categories**: Provides type safety and prevents invalid category values
- **String Values in Enum**: Easier debugging and serialization compared to numeric enums
- **Separate createdAt**: Tracks when expense was added vs. when it occurred
- **Optional Note**: Flexibility without requiring data for every expense

### 2. ExpenseStateService (`core/services/expense-state.ts`)

**Purpose**: Centralized reactive state management for expense data

**Key Implementation Details**:

```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class ExpenseStateService {
  private expenses = new BehaviorSubject<Expense[]>(this.getSampleData());
  expenses$ = this.expenses.asObservable();

  addExpense(expense: Expense): void {
    const currentExpenses = this.expenses.value;
    this.expenses.next([expense, ...currentExpenses]);
  }

  deleteExpense(expenseId: string): void {
    const currentExpenses = this.expenses.value;
    const updatedExpenses = currentExpenses.filter(expense => expense.id !== expenseId);
    this.expenses.next(updatedExpenses);
  }
}
```

**Implementation Reasoning**:
- **BehaviorSubject**: Maintains current state and emits to new subscribers immediately
- **Immutable Updates**: `[expense, ...currentExpenses]` creates new arrays preventing reference issues
- **Observable Exposure**: Public `expenses$` ensures components can't directly modify state
- **Sample Data**: Provides immediate functionality for demo/testing purposes

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain the single source of truth for expense data
- Provide reactive streams for components to subscribe to
- Handle CRUD operations with immutable updates
- Calculate derived data like totals

### 3. ExpenseService (`core/services/expense.ts`)

**Purpose**: Handle HTTP operations and business logic for expense data

**Implementation Reasoning**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps state management separate from data operations
- **Future Extensibility**: Ready for backend integration when needed
- **Business Logic**: Handles validation and data transformation

---

## Features Module Analysis

### 1. Dashboard Component (`features/expenses/pages/dashboard/dashboard.ts`)

**Purpose**: Main application dashboard displaying expense overview and analytics

**Key Features**:
- Real-time expense totals
- Interactive Chart.js donut chart
- Recent expenses list
- Category-based spending breakdown

**Implementation Reasoning**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './dashboard.html',
  styles: [/* Inline styles for immediate loading */]
})
export class DashboardComponent implements OnInit, AfterViewInit, OnDestroy {
  @ViewChild('chartCanvas', { static: false }) chartCanvas!: ElementRef<HTMLCanvasElement>;
  
  expenses$: Observable<Expense[]>;
  totalExpenses$: Observable<number>;
  recentExpenses$: Observable<Expense[]>;
  categoryTotals$: Observable<CategoryTotal[]>;
```

**Why Chart.js**: 
- **Performance**: Better performance than Angular-specific chart libraries
- **Customization**: Full control over chart appearance and behavior
- **Interactive Features**: Built-in legend clicking and hover effects
- **Community**: Large ecosystem and extensive documentation

**Why Inline Styles**:
- **Performance**: Eliminates additional HTTP requests for external stylesheets
- **Component Encapsulation**: Styles are tightly coupled with component logic
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug styling issues during development

### 2. Add Expense Component (`features/expenses/pages/add-expense/add-expense.ts`)

**Purpose**: Form for creating new expenses with validation

**Implementation Strategy**:

```typescript
private createForm(): FormGroup {
  return this.fb.group({
    amount: ['', [
      Validators.required, 
      Validators.min(0.01),
      Validators.pattern(/^\d+(\.\d{1,2})?$/)
    ]],
    category: ['', Validators.required],
    date: [this.formatDateForInput(new Date()), Validators.required],
    note: ['', Validators.maxLength(500)]
  });
}
```

**Why Reactive Forms**:
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration than template-driven forms
- **Validation Control**: Programmatic control over validation logic
- **Testing**: Easier to unit test form logic
- **Complex Validation**: Support for cross-field validation when needed

**Validation Strategy**:
- **Amount Pattern**: Ensures monetary format (up to 2 decimal places)
- **Category Required**: Prevents uncategorized expenses
- **Default Date**: User convenience with today's date
- **Note Length**: Prevents excessive note storage

### 3. Expense List Component (`features/expenses/pages/expense-list/expense-list.ts`)

**Purpose**: Display, filter, and manage existing expenses

**Implementation Features**:
- Real-time filtering by category, date range, and text search
- Expense deletion with confirmation
- Responsive list display

**Why Advanced Filtering**:
- **User Experience**: Quick expense lookup in large datasets
- **Performance**: Client-side filtering for immediate feedback
- **Flexibility**: Multiple filter criteria can be combined

---

## Shared Module Analysis

### 1. Shared Module Structure (`shared/shared.module.ts`)

**Purpose**: Centralize reusable components and commonly used Angular modules

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ConfirmationDialogComponent,
    ExpenseItemComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
  exports: [
    CommonModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    FormsModule,
    ConfirmationDialogComponent,
    ExpenseItemComponent
  ]
})
export class SharedModule { }
```

**Implementation Reasoning**:
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid importing common modules in every feature module
- **Consistency**: Shared components ensure consistent UI across features
- **Maintainability**: Single place to manage common dependencies

### 2. Expense Chart Component (`shared/components/expense-chart/expense-chart.ts`)

**Purpose**: Reusable Chart.js wrapper for expense visualization

**Key Implementation Details**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-expense-chart',
  templateUrl: './expense-chart.html',
  styleUrls: ['./expense-chart.scss'],
  standalone: false
})
export class ExpenseChartComponent implements OnInit, OnChanges, OnDestroy {
  @Input() expenses: Expense[] = [];
  private chart: Chart | null = null;

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    if (this.chart) {
      this.chart.destroy();
    }
  }
}
```

**Why This Approach**:
- **Reusability**: Can be used in multiple components (dashboard, reports)
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Input-Driven**: Reactive to data changes via OnChanges
- **Encapsulation**: Chart logic separated from business logic

### 3. Confirmation Dialog Component (`shared/components/confirmation-dialog/`)

**Purpose**: Reusable modal for user confirmations (delete actions)

**Implementation Benefits**:
- **User Safety**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Consistency**: Same confirmation experience across the app
- **Accessibility**: Modal focuses and keyboard navigation

---

## State Management Strategy

### Reactive Data Flow

**Architecture Pattern**: Observer Pattern with RxJS

```typescript
// Service publishes state changes
private expenses = new BehaviorSubject<Expense[]>(this.getSampleData());
expenses$ = this.expenses.asObservable();

// Components subscribe to state changes
this.expenses$ = this.expenseState.expenses$;
this.totalExpenses$ = this.expenseState.getTotalExpenses();
```

**Why This Pattern**:
- **Predictable**: Single source of truth for application state
- **Reactive**: Automatic UI updates when data changes
- **Decoupled**: Components don't need to know about each other
- **Testable**: Easy to mock observables in unit tests

### Data Transformation Pipeline

**Implementation Strategy**:
```typescript
// Derived data calculations
this.categoryTotals$ = this.expenses$.pipe(
  map(expenses => this.calculateCategoryTotals(expenses))
);

this.recentExpenses$ = this.expenses$.pipe(
  map(expenses => expenses.slice(0, 5))
);
```

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: Calculations only happen when source data changes
- **Memory Efficiency**: No need to store derived data
- **Consistency**: Derived data always reflects current state

---

## UI/UX Implementation

### 1. Styling Strategy

**Approach**: Combination of SCSS and inline styles

**File Structure**:
- `src/styles.scss`: Global styles and CSS variables
- Component-specific `.scss`: Component styling
- Inline styles: Critical path and dynamic styling

**Why This Approach**:
- **Performance**: Critical styles loaded immediately
- **Maintainability**: Component-specific styles stay with components
- **Consistency**: Global styles for shared design tokens

### 2. Responsive Design

**Implementation**: CSS Grid and Flexbox

```scss
.top-section {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
  width: 100%;
}

.dashboard-card {
  flex: 1;
  min-width: 0;  // Prevents flex items from overflowing
}
```

**Design Decisions**:
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive breakpoints prioritize mobile experience
- **Flexible Layout**: CSS Grid for complex layouts, Flexbox for simple arrangements
- **Performance**: CSS-only responsive design (no JavaScript media queries)

### 3. Interactive Elements

**Chart Interactions**:
- Click legend to hide/show categories
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Responsive sizing based on container

**Form Interactions**:
- Real-time validation feedback
- Automatic date formatting
- Category selection with visual feedback

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing Approach

**Framework**: Jasmine + Karma with Angular Testing Utilities

**Testing Philosophy**:
- **Component Testing**: Focus on component logic and user interactions
- **Service Testing**: Test business logic and state management
- **Integration Testing**: Test component-service interactions

**Key Test Files**:
- `expense-state.spec.ts`: State management and reactive updates
- `add-expense.spec.ts`: Form validation and submission
- `dashboard.spec.ts`: Chart integration and data display

### 2. End-to-End Testing

**Framework**: Cypress

**Test Coverage**:
- `smoke.cy.ts`: Basic application loading and navigation
- `add-expense.cy.ts`: Complete expense creation workflow
- `dashboard.cy.ts`: Dashboard functionality and chart interactions

**Why Cypress**:
- **Real Browser Testing**: Tests actual user experience
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent debugging tools and visual feedback
- **Modern Architecture**: Better than Protractor for Angular applications

### 3. Testing Strategy Reasoning

**Comprehensive Coverage**:
- **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback for business logic
- **E2E Tests**: Ensure user workflows function correctly
- **Integration**: Verify component and service interactions

**Purpose**: Standardized build process and development tools

**Key Features**:
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- SCSS preprocessing
- Development server with hot reload
- Production optimization (tree shaking, minification)

### 2. Development Dependencies

**Chart.js Integration**:
```json
"chart.js": "^4.5.0",
"ng2-charts": "^8.0.0"
```

**Why Chart.js 4.5**:
- **Performance**: Latest version with optimizations
- **TypeScript Support**: Better type definitions
- **Tree Shaking**: Only used chart components are bundled

**Cypress Testing**:
```json
"cypress": "^14.5.1",
"concurrently": "^9.2.0"
```

**Why Concurrently**:
- **Developer Experience**: Run dev server and tests simultaneously
- **CI/CD**: Simplified test running in automated environments

### 3. Code Quality Tools

**Prettier Configuration**:
```json
"prettier": {
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.html",
      "options": {
        "parser": "angular"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Consistent code formatting across the team

## Data Flow & Component Interactions

### 1. Application Data Flow

```
User Action → Component → Service → State Update → Observable Emission → UI Update
```

**Example: Adding an Expense**
1. User submits form in `AddExpenseComponent`
2. Component calls `expenseState.addExpense()`
3. `ExpenseStateService` updates BehaviorSubject
4. All subscribed components receive updated data
5. Dashboard and list views automatically refresh

### 2. Component Communication

**Parent-Child**: `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators
```typescript
// Parent passes data down
<app-expense-chart [expenses]="expenses$ | async"></app-expense-chart>

// Child emits events up
@Output() deleteExpense = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

**Service-Mediated**: Shared services for complex interactions
```typescript
// Multiple components subscribe to same service
this.expenses$ = this.expenseState.expenses$;
```

### 3. Reactive Programming Benefits

**Automatic Updates**: When expense data changes, all dependent views update automatically:
- Dashboard totals recalculate
- Charts redraw with new data
- Recent expenses list updates
- Category summaries refresh

**Memory Management**: RxJS handles subscription lifecycle:
- OnDestroy hooks unsubscribe from observables
- No manual event listener cleanup required
- Prevents memory leaks in single-page application
